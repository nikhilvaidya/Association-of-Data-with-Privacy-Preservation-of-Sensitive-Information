# Association-of-Data-with-Privacy-Preservation-of-Sensitive-Information
One of the major tasks of finding the interesting patterns from the large repositories of data is performed by applying the association rules of different kinds. While carrying out this process, some sensitive information face disclosure in front of the unauthorized users which should be taken care of and this is carried out by the process of privacy preservation. This project presents an approach that modifies few transactions in the transaction database so that it gains the support factor sensitive rules and confidence factor of sensitive rules and reduces side effects. The technique presented in this project will increase the number of hidden sensitive rules and also will help in reducing the number of modified entries. The approach used will avoid the undesired side effects in this rule hiding process. The factor of scalability is also mainly focused so that it incompatible with different sizes of database.
